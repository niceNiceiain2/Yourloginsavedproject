# Yourloginsavedproject

This project is from my CS 4413 Web Technologies course. 
Itâ€™s a simple login system where users can sign up, log in, and have their information securely saved in a database. 


This project allows users to create a login, log in, and securely store their credentials in a backend database.
It demonstrates my ability to build a functional full-stack web application.

Features:

Sign-Up Form: Users can create an account by entering their information (email, username, password, etc.)
Login Form: Registered users can log in using their information.
Database: User information is sent to a backend database using PHP and stored in a table called "Database Entries."


Technologies Used:

Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Backend: PHP
Database: MySQL


How It Works:
The user visits the login page of Yourloginsavedproject.
They can:
Sign up by providing their information (e.g., email, username, password, phone number).
Log in with their registered credentials.
When users sign up, their information is sent to the backend using PHP and saved in a MySQL database.



About my Project:
This project was part of my coursework. It demonstrates my ability to:
Combine frontend and backend technologies to create a full-stack application.
Build user friendly interfaces and handle secure data storage.
I am passionate about web development and always looking for ways to improve my skills and take on new challenges.
